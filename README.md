This project helps users visualize their time allocation through intuitive grids:
âœ¨ Life View: Interactive age grid (up to 80 years) with animated water ripple showing current year's progress percentage
ðŸ“… Nested Time Perspectives: Year/Month/Week/Day views with similar visualization patterns
ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose: Promote time consciousness using fading color schemes (gray for past, green for future) to prioritize meaningful matters
